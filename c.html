                <h1> C programming </h1>
                <p> 
                    C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured 
                    programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type 
                    system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical 
                    machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications previously 
                    coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems 
                    and various application software for computer architectures that range 
                    from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to 
                    be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language 
                    constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all 
                    with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, 
                    the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. 
                    A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind 
                    can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and 
                    operating systems with few changes to its source code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of January 2021, C was ranked first in the TIOBE index, 
                    a measure of the popularity of programming languages, 
                    moving up from the no. 2 spot the previous year.

                <h3> History </h3>
                <p> 
                    The origin of C is closely tied to the development of the 
                    Unix operating system, originally implemented in assembly 
                    language on a PDP-7 by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson, 
                    incorporating several ideas from colleagues. Eventually, 
                    they decided to port the operating system to a PDP-11. 
                    The original PDP-11 version of Unix was also developed in 
                    assembly language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thompson desired a programming language to make utilities 
                    for the new platform. At first, he tried to make a 
                    Fortran compiler, but soon gave up the idea. Instead, 
                    he created a cut-down version of the recently developed 
                    BCPL systems programming language. The official description 
                    of BCPL was not available at the time, and Thompson modified 
                    the syntax to be less wordy, producing the similar but 
                    somewhat simpler B.[6] However, few utilities were ultimately 
                    written in B because it was too slow, and B could not take advantage 
                    of PDP-11 features such as byte addressability.

                    <code> 
                        #include&lt;conio.h&gt;
                        int main()
                        {
                            printf("Hello world");
                        }
                    </code>

                <p> 
                    C has both directly and indirectly influenced many later 
                    languages such as C#, D, Go, Java, JavaScript, Limbo, LPC, 
                    Perl, PHP, Python, and Unix's C shell. The most pervasive 
                    influence has been syntactical; all of the languages mentioned 
                    combine the statement and (more or less recognizably) expression 
                    syntax of C with type systems, data models, and/or large-scale 
                    program structures that differ from those of C, sometimes radically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Several C or near-C interpreters exist, including Ch and 
                    CINT, which can also be used for scripting.<br>
                    When object-oriented languages became popular, C++ and 
                    Objective-C were two different extensions of C that provided 
                    object-oriented capabilities. Both languages were originally implemented 
                    as source-to-source compilers; source code was translated into C, 
                    and then compiled with a C compiler.
