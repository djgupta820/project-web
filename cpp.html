                    C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne 
                    Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or 
                    "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over 
                    time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and 
                    functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory 
                    manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, 
                    and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software 
                    Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is 
                    available on many platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    C++ was designed with an orientation toward system programming and 
                    embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with 
                    performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.
                    C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths 
                    being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including 
                    desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or 
                    databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches 
                    or space probes).

                <h3> History </h3>
                <p> 
                    In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began 
                    work on "C with Classes", the predecessor to C++.The motivation
                    for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience 
                    in programming for his PhD thesis. Stroustrup found that Simula had 
                    features that were very helpful for large software development, but 
                    the language was too slow for practical use, while BCPL was fast but 
                    too low-level to be suitable for large software development. When 
                    Stroustrup started working in AT&T Bell Labs, he had the problem of 
                    analyzing the UNIX kernel with respect to distributed computing. 
                    Remembering his PhD experience, Stroustrup set out to enhance the 
                    C language with Simula-like features. C was chosen because it was 
                    general-purpose, fast, portable and widely used. As well as C and 
                    Simula's influences, other languages also influenced this new language, 
                    including ALGOL 68, Ada, CLU and ML.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initially, Stroustrup's "C with Classes" added features to the C compiler, 
                    Cpre, including classes, derived classes, strong typing, inlining and 
                    default arguments.

                <h3> Philosophy </h3>
                <p> 
                    Throughout C++'s life, its development and evolution has been 
                    guided by a set of principles:
                    <ul> 
                        <li> It must be driven by actual problems and its features should be immediately useful in real world programs.</li>
                        <li> Every feature should be implementable (with a reasonably obvious way to do so). </li>
                        <li> Programmers should be free to pick their own programming style, and that style should be fully supported by C++. </li>
                        <li> Allowing a useful feature is more important than preventing every possible misuse of C++. </li>
                        <li> It should provide facilities for organising programs into separate, well-defined parts, and provide facilities for combining separately developed parts. </li>
                        <li> No implicit violations of the type system (but allow explicit violations; that is, those explicitly requested by the programmer). </li>
                        <li> User-created types need to have the same support and performance as built-in types. </li>
                        <li> Unused features should not negatively impact created executables (e.g. in lower performance). </li>
                        <li> There should be no language beneath C++ (except assembly language). </li>
                        <li> C++ should work alongside other existing programming languages, rather than fostering its own separate and incompatible programming environment. </li>
                        <li> If the programmer's intent is unknown, allow the programmer to specify it by providing manual control. </li>
                    </ul>
