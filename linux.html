                <h1> Linux (Operating System) </h1>
                <p> 
                    Linux LEEN-uuks is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Distributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name "GNU/Linux" to emphasize the importance of GNU software, causing some controversy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Popular Linux distributions include Debian, Fedora, and Ubuntu. Commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland, and a desktop environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma. Distributions intended for servers may omit graphics altogether, or include a solution stack such as LAMP. Because Linux is freely redistributable, anyone may create a distribution for any purpose.
                    Linux was originally developed for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating system.

                <h3> History </h3>
                <p> 
                    The Unix operating system was conceived and implemented in 1969, at AT&T's Bell Labs, in the United States by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna. First released in 1971, Unix was written entirely in assembly language, as was common practice at the time. In 1973 in a key, pioneering approach, it was rewritten in the C programming language by Dennis Ritchie (with the exception of some hardware and I/O routines). The availability of a high-level language implementation of Unix made its porting to different computer platforms easier.

                <h3> The Linux Kernel  </h3>
                <p> 
                   The 1st Linux kernel was released to the public with Version 0.01, on May 14 in 1991. It had no networking feature and was able to run only on 80386-compatible Intel processors and hardware and had a tremendously limited device driver support. The virtual memory subsystem was also quite basic and incorporated no support for memory-mapped files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next milestone for Linux was Linux 1.0 which was released on March 14 in 1994. With this release terminated three years of fast development of Linux kernel. Possibly the single significant new feature was networking version 1.0 which incorporated support for UNIX's standard TCP/IP protocol suite, as well as a BSD compatible socket interface for providing network programming. A wide range of extra hardware support was also included in this release.
                </p>
                <p>
                    System V UNIX-style inter-process communication (IPC), includes collective memory, semaphores as well as message queues was also implemented. Simple support for dynamically loadable and unloadable kernel modules was supplied as well.
