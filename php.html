                <h1> PHP (HyperText PreProcessor) </h1>
                <p> 
                    PHP is a general-purpose scripting language especially suited 
                    to web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian 
                    programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation 
                    is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for Personal 
                    Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism 
                    PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter 
                    implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface 
                    (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted 
                    and executed PHP code – which may be any type of data, such as 
                    generated HTML or binary image data – would form the whole or 
                    part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, 
                    web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which 
                    can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of 
                    that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming 
                    tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical 
                    applications and robotic drone control. PHP code can also be 
                    directly executed from the command line.
                </p>
                <p>The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is 
                    free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely 
                    ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every 
                    operating system and platform, free of charge.The PHP language 
                    evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 
                    2014, with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard 
                    which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has 
                    gone on to create a formal PHP specification.

                <h3> Early history </h3>
                <p> 
                    PHP development began in 1994 when Rasmus Lerdorf wrote several 
                    Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs in C, which he used to 
                    maintain his personal homepage. He extended them to work with 
                    web forms and to communicate with databases, and called this 
                    implementation "Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter" or PHP/FI.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PHP/FI could be used to build simple, dynamic web applications. 
                    To accelerate bug reporting and improve the code, Lerdorf initially 
                    announced the release of PHP/FI as 
                    "Personal Home Page Tools (PHP Tools) version 1.0" on the Usenet 
                    discussion group comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi on June 8, 
                    1995. This release already had the basic functionality that PHP has 
                    today. This included Perl-like variables, form handling, and the 
                    ability to embed HTML. The syntax resembled that of Perl, but was 
                    simpler, more limited and less consistent.
                </p>
                <p> An example of the early PHP syntax: </p>

                    <code> 
                        <!--include /text/header.html-->

                        <!--getenv HTTP_USER_AGENT-->
                        <!--if substr $exec_result Mozilla-->
                        Hey, you are using Netscape!<p>
                        <!--endif-->

                        <!--sql database select * from table where user='$username'-->
                        <!--ifless $numentries 1-->
                        Sorry, that record does not exist<p>
                        <!--endif exit-->
                        Welcome <!--$user-->!<p>
                        You have <!--$index:0--> credits left in your account.<p>

                        <!--include /text/footer.html-->

                <h3> Implementations </h3>
                <p> 
                    The only complete PHP implementation is the original, known 
                    simply as PHP. It is the most widely used and is powered by 
                    the Zend Engine. To disambiguate it from other implementations, 
                    it is sometimes unofficially called "Zend PHP". The Zend Engine 
                    compiles PHP source code on-the-fly into an internal format that it 
                    can execute, thus it works as an interpreter. It is also the 
                    "reference implementation" of PHP, as PHP has no formal specification, 
                    and so the semantics of Zend PHP define the semantics of PHP. Due to 
                    the complex and nuanced semantics of PHP, defined by how Zend works, 
                    it is difficult for competing implementations to offer complete compatibility.
